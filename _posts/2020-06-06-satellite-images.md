I spent 15 years of my career working on very high precision opticial angle encoders
that were used in satellites to provide position feedback as the camera systems
did scans of their field of view. The accuracy required from these encoders was
on the order of 10 arc-seconds with an update rate of 1600 Hz. 

The Himawari-8 and (some of the) GOES series satellites
use these encoders when capturing images. 

It is very interesting for me to be able to see the full disk images and know
that I helped in a small way to make them possible.

The MAC application [Downlink](https://downlinkapp.com/) uses these images,
and the author kindly presents the [sources](https://downlinkapp.com/sources.json)
for the images.
