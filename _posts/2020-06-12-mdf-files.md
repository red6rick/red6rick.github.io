I do a bit of Forth. Just a bit. 

Some of it is getting pretty dense, and I've started putting some of it onto
my github repo [forthbox](https://github.com/red6rick/forthbox). 

That's where I am keeping up with things on my mind and various extensions and
enhancements to [SwiftForth](https://www.forth.com/swiftforth/). 

I've done Forth for a long time, and I've never been particularly happy with
the way I (or anyone else, for that matter) documents their code. And I have
lately been using github-flavored Markdown for this blog among other things.

To scratch my itch, I want to be able to intermix markdown and Forth seamlessly.
So, I'm going to create a new filetype for myself ( ```.MDF``` ) "markdown forth"
and build a version of ```INCLUDE``` in SwiftForth that can deal with it.

The biggest feature is that the file will be assumed to always start in a 
comment which will be any valid markdown code. The actual code for Forth to
compile and/or interpret will begin in the first block-delimited code block
which is designated by three back-ticks at the beginning of a line.

We'll see how it works; might be really nice!
