Oh, confusion! Welcome back friend!

I've been Hackintoshing for about 8 years now. I love the results.
The path is sometime a little convoluted, and has gotten more confusing
since the last machine I built (in 2015).

But, here we go again.

Resources: [TonyMacx86]() is my go-to. And [Amazon](). And [NewEgg]()

Hardware:
1. Gigabyte Motherboard. I don't go for the really high-end, but ...
   I want to max out ram. The newer ones have 128GB capacity.
   * [Z390 Designare](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07K8RJZRG/?tag=tonymacx86com-20)
   has two ethernet ports, usb-c, and etc.
2. Intel processor.
   * [i7=9700F](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07S8DWXT3/)
   * [i7-8700](https://www.bhphotovideo.com/c/product/1356633-REG/intel_bx80684i78700_core_i7_8700_3_2_ghz.html)
3. Memory -- I'm starting with half of MB capacity at 2x32GB, 
   * [Corsair](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B081BTGNDW/) or
   * [Viper](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0865HHQYT/)
4. Power supply, a modular one like this.    It is possible to spend a lot more money, nah...
   * [Rosewill](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00PCLGZOC)

5. Cooling. Standard, not planning to overclock (today)
   * [Intel standard fan](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013U542QE]
6. Case. A blank case. I don't want leds flashing at me all the time.
   * [Antec](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07LBXP8KZ)
7. Video card. I have a decent 570; do I want to buy a 580?
   * [Radeon RX 850](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06Y66K3XD)
8. Monitors. Hah!
9. Keyboard, mouse, etc. Hah!
